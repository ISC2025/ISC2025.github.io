<strong>Abstract</strong>: AI coding assistants, such as GitHub Copilot, have quickly become an integral part of developers&rsquo; everyday workflows, but how safe is the code they generate? In this talk, I’ll dive into what makes AI-generated code insecure, drawing from recent case studies and experiments. I&rsquo;ll walk through efforts to improve security using fine-tuning, prompt engineering, and retrieval-augmented techniques, as well as our own approach to automated patch generation using vulnerability logs. This talk highlights both the potential and the current gaps in making large language models truly helpful for secure programming. The goal is to move beyond fixing bugs to actually teaching models why code is secure.</p>
<p><strong>Biography</strong>: Hyoungshick Kim is a professor in the Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Sungkyunkwan University. He received a BS degree from
the Department of Information Engineering at Sungkyunkwan University, an MS from the Department of Computer Science at KAIST, and a Ph.D. from the Computer Laboratory at the University of Cambridge in 1999, 2001, and 2011, respectively. After completing his Ph.D., he worked as a post-doctoral fellow in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at the University of British Columbia. He previously worked as a senior engineer at Samsung Electronics from 2004 to 2008. He also worked as a distinguished visiting researcher at CSIRO Data61 from 2019 to 2020. His current research interests include usable security, software security, and data-driven security. He enjoys finding security issues in new systems, particularly recent AI systems
and applications, and has been deeply engaged in identifying real security problems in these areas. His work aims to uncover and address the practical security challenges posed by emerging technologies.</p>

<strong>Abstract</strong>: Hardware trojans (HTs) represent one of the most challenging threat models in computer security. Due to the complexity and distributed nature of today’s electronics supply chains, there has been significant interest in developing scalable and accurate techniques for identifying such embedded malicious logic, at least in critical systems. However, much of the research in such techniques focuses on small target circuits with impractical HT usage (i.e., attack) scenarios, leading to both to questionable defenses and potential blind spots. In particular, most scenarios ascribe perfect knowledge and embedding control to the HT owner, consider simple (verging on simplistic) trigger and payload mechanisms, and cast the HT-attacker-defender interaction as a single shot game.
In this talk, I will discuss a new model for hardware trojans that targets realistic circuits (i.e., full-blown CPUs) in the context of imperfect knowledge/control by the attacker and an adaptive defender within a repeated game, and explore certain implications and technical challenges.</p>
<p><strong>Biography</strong>: Dr. Angelos D. Keromytis is Professor, John H. Weitnauer EndowedChair, and Georgia Research Alliance (GRA) Eminent Scholar at the Georgia Institute of Technology. His field of research is systems and network security, and applied cryptography.
He came to Georgia Tech from DARPA, where he served as Program Manager in the Information Innovation Office (I2O) from 2014 to 2018. Prior to DARPA, he served as Program Director with the Computer and Network Systems Division in the Directorate for Computer and Information Science &amp; Engineering (CISE) at the National Science Foundation (NSF). Prior to his public service tour, Dr. Keromytis was a faculty member with the Department of Computer Science at Columbia University, where he founded the Network Security Lab.
Dr. Keromytis is an elected Fellow of the ACM and the IEEE. He is a co-inventor on 63 issued U.S. patents and an author/co-author of over 300 refereed publications. His work has been cited 30,000 times, with an h-index of 85 and i10-index of 260. He has co-founded four technology startups. He received his Ph.D. (2001) and M.Sc. (1997) in Computer Science from the University of Pennsylvania, and his B.Sc. in Computer Science from the University of Crete, Greece. He is a certified PADI Master Instructor, with over 700 dives.</p>
